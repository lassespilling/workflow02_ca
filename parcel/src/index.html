				Nuts have also been shown to help provide an edge against stroke and type 2 diabetes, curb appetite, and encourage weight loss, as studies indicate that calories from nuts don't always correlate with the expected amount of weight gain. Nuts also give vegetarians a guiltless <a href="protein.html" title="goto protein" role="link">protein</a> source that rivals any meat, and they mix well any number of diverse dishes.<sup><a href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/5-nuts-that-can-revolutionize-your-diet.html" title="content from bodybuilding.com">1</a></sup>

				I'm talking about seeds, which prove that big things come in small packages. In fact, many seeds are absolute nutritional giants! Replete with healthy <a href="fats.html" title="goto fats" role="link">fats</a>, <a href="protein.html" title="goto protein" role="link">protein</a>, and a range of micronutrients, seeds can be your secret weapon to eating better than ever. Think of them as pint-sized foods with super-sized benefits.

				Even prepared beans, such as baked and refried, can be bodybuilding friendly. Check labels on canned and prepared beans--some types can be loaded with unhealthy fats and salt, and you generally want to avoid canned beans that include bacon. Don’t worry though - with so many healthy versions available, you’ll have no problem choosing a bean that suits your tastes.
